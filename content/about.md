In case you're curious, I used [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/hugo.html) which uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) internally. This theme is based on [ezhil](https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil) (with some modification). I like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), but prefer [Nvim-R](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R) which is great if you like [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) & [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal). 

The source code (of blogdown & hugo bits) is avaible [here](https://github.com/sung/sung.gong.hugo) and the [static contents](https://github.com/sung/sung.github.io) are deployed on [GitHub](https://github.com). You may find [this](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) useful, if you'd like to make your github page as a submodle of your Hugo codes.
